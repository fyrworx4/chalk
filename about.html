  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm a university student studying cybersecurity. I like pentesting/red team stuff as well.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I currently represent my university as the team
    captain of our CCDC team and an incoming member of our 
    CPTC team.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I am also the president of <a href="https://www.calpolyswift.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWIFT, or Students 
    With an Interest in the Future of Technology,</a> where I 
    share my passions and knowledge of cybersecurity with 
    others.
  </p>  
  <br>
  <p>
    When I'm not doing cybersecurity stuff, you can 
    find me at the gym or making music!
  </p>
