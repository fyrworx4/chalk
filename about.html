  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm an incoming red team intern for CrowdStrike, but 
    my experiences within college lie within the blue-teaming 
    side of things.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently represent my university as the team
    captain of our CCDC team and an incoming member of our 
    CPTC team. I am also the president of SWIFT, or Students 
    With an Interest in the Future of Technology, where I 
    share my passions and knowledge of cybersecurity with 
    others. When I'm not doing cybersecurity stuff, you can 
    find me at the gym or making music!
