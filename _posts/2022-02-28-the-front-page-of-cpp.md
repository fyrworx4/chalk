Lots of great things happened for SWIFT this year so far. The resurgence of Red vs. Blue. In-person meetings. Inclusive community. 1st place in the world in CPTC.

(Let's just talk about that for a minute.)

Out of all of the time I've been in SWIFT, this year is the year I've witnessed the most growth in our organization. SWIFT, or Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology, is the largest cybersecurity organization at Cal Poly Pomona centered around cybersecurity, computer networking, and system administration.

I want all members, both eboard and general members, to walk away from SWIFT being able to comfortably talk about their accomplishments in SWIFT and have something on their resume to showcase what they've done in our meetings and workshops.

But I also want our members to feel like they belong. **Because cybersecurity shouldn't be a solo mission.**

This vision spread beyond SWIFT and into the competition teams, and the fruits of our labor really showed. <a href="https://cp.tc/blog/cptc-2021-finals-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our CPTC team won 1st place in the world.</a>

Few months later, we were on the front page of our school's website.

There was also a <a href="https://polycentric.cpp.edu/2022/02/cal-poly-pomona-cybersecurity-team-wins-international-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> about our victory on the PolyCentric website.

There were so many factors that attributed to the team's success. Great technical skills and presentation skills, an undying passion for cybersecurity, but what I think made the biggest difference is the feeling of community. Everyone was friends with each other; there wasn't any beef between any of the team members.

I think that heavily contributed to team morale and synergy.

It's great to have the accomplishments of our team be recognized.
