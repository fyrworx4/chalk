Lots of great things happened for SWIFT this year so far. The resurgence of Red vs. Blue. In-person meetings. Inclusive community. 1st place in the world in CPTC.

(Let's just talk about that for a minute.)

Out of all of the time I've been in SWIFT, this year is the year I've witnessed the most growth in our organization. SWIFT, or Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology, is the largest cybersecurity organization at Cal Poly Pomona centered around cybersecurity, computer networking, and system administration. And as president, I envision to reduce the barriers of entries for both gaining technical skills and joining our community.

I want all members, both eboard and general members, to walk away from SWIFT being able to comfortably talk about their accomplishments in SWIFT and have something on their resume to showcase what they've done in our meetings and workshops.

But I also want our members to feel like they belong. **Because cybersecurity shouldn't be a solo mission.**

And through both eboard and the competition teams, the fruits of our labor really shows.
