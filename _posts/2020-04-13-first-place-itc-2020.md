Ever heard of the saying “the show must go on?”

In this day and age, this quote has never been more true.

Things like work, school, and projects must be continued under these unexpected and unpredictable times.

Or in this case, cybersecurity competitions.

Over the course of three weeks, my four teammates and I had recently worked on a case competition in Cal Poly Pomona's 24th annual [Information Technology Competition][itc-link], or ITC, under the Digital Forensics category.

# About ITC

In ITC, teams are given a case study to work on for three weeks prior to the actual competition day - 2 weeks to complete various deliverables, and 1 week to prepare a presentation to a panel of judges. It's designed to give students some competition experience in a wide range of disciplines, including IT Strategy, IT Security, Data Analytics, Application Development, and Digital Forensics.

# The Challenges

It was a challenging process. We all ran into technical issues, whether it be Autopsy crashing or using [VMware Fusison][vmware-fusion]. Furthermore, we're all new to digital forensics so we were going in blind. As the lead for our team, I divided up the work amongst my teammates into two categories - technical portion and the reporting portion.

## Technical Portion

The technical portion was all about actually examining the disk image that we were provided with. We analyzed a Windows 10 .vmdk image and looked specifically into various artifacts that helped us get a bigger picture of actions that were taken on the device.

## Reporting Portion

All the findings that we gathered, as well as the tools and methodologies that we used were all put into a neatly-written report. These tasks were mainly for the teammates that had less technical experience, but nonetheless still an integral part of our deliverable.

# Presentation

The day before our presentation, I reiterated to my team that **it’s not about what place we get, but instead it's about getting the experience and learning something new.** 

Our presentation went smoothly, but we were hit with tough questions at the end in which some of them we weren’t able to answer. But with only two other teams competing, we were guaranteed to place so we weren’t too worried.

In the end, our team won 1st place out of the three teams. We also received feedback on our report and presentation as well as suggestions to improve our methodologies when performing a forensics examination.

# Learning Outcomes

Overall the grind was well worth it. But there were three things that I took away from this competition:

- Don't make assumptions in digital forensics, stick with the facts.
- Having a diverse team with unique skill sets will strengthen your work.
- It’s more about gaining the experience rather than winning the competition. (This is a good talking point when you’re in a resume or job fair)
- [Google][google] is your best friend.
