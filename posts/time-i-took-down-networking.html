            <p>I’ve done computer networking for a while now. In fact, in my CCDC team, I opted to be the networking lead and became the de-facto person in my cybersecurity organization to talk about computer networking.</p>

<p>It’s more of a love-hate relationship. Networking is super interesting to me, but even a few small changes can bring down an entire network. And I hate networking because of that.</p>

<p>And I’m notorious for bringing down networks. It’s how my role in CCDC became nicknamed the “not-working” team. There would be many times where I accidently applied an ACL (access control list) that would block a scoring service from reaching outside the network, bringing us down for a few hours until someone realizes that it’s a networking problem.</p>

<p>Despite that, I’m still the go-to person for any networking needs.</p>

<h1 id="the-student-data-center">The Student Data Center</h1>

<p>This past summer, I had the opportunity to redo some of the networking infrastructure for my school, specifically the Student Data Center (SDC for short) designed for cybersecurity labs, class demonstrations, etc.</p>

<p>I assisted with planning out and pushing for a networking configuration that would give us the most bandwidth, while at the same time, have redundancy all over the place. Redundant links, switches, and more.</p>

<p>The problem was that there wasn’t enough documentation for me to understand how the networking was setup before, so there was no way of telling if there were devices that were owned by the school, or owned by the Student Data Center.</p>

<h1 id="password-reset">Password Reset</h1>

<p>One day, I discovered two Cisco switches that connected the lab to the Internet, and I wanted to see the configuration of those switches. Problem was, I didn’t know the passwords to them. There wasn’t any documentation on any of the switches, so <em>wouldn’t it be a great idea to flex my Cisco knowledge and do a password reset on the switches?</em></p>

<p>It wasn’t a great idea.</p>

<p>For some reason, after my first password reset, the commands of the previous configuration were all being automatically inputted into the switch, and some of them were generating errors. I had no idea what was going on, so I just continued on and saw if I could do a <code class="highlighter-rouge">show run</code> on the switch.</p>

<p>And it seemed that the previous configurations were totally wiped out from the switch.</p>

<p>Meaning that I took down our connection to the Internet.</p>

<p>To make matters even worse, the Cisco switches were school property, meaning that what I did was <em>technically</em> unauthorized.</p>

<p>I probably should have asked which devices were in scope for this project, but at the same time, I’m glad that I did it in a lab environment, where there is a lot more room for failure than something like a business.</p>

<p>Lesson learned - always ask before doing something.</p>

<h1 id="update---3142022">Update - 3/14/2022</h1>

<p>Happy Pi day! We’re finally able to get back into the SDC after about a year. Time to undo my wrongdoings…</p>
